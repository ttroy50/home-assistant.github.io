The `ephember` climate platform lets you control [EPH Controls](http://emberapp.ephcontrols.com/) thermostats. The module only works if you have a WiFi gateway to control your EPH system and an account on the ember app.

To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: ephember
    username: YOUR_EMAIL
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

A single interface can handle up to 32 connected devices.

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): The email address you used to sign up to the ember app
- **password** (*Required*): The password you used to sign up to the ember app

The supported operation modes map to the ON/OFF period selection of your timeswitch / EphEmber app. These include:

- **Auto** The timeswitch operates 3 on / off periods per day.
- **All Day** The timeswitch operates 1 on / off period per day. This operates from the first on time to the third off time.
- **On** The timeswitch is permanently on.
- **Off** The timeswitch is permanently off.
